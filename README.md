Welcome to the **WhatsApp Chat Insights** project! This tool provides in-depth analysis and visualizations of your WhatsApp chat data. By processing an exported chat file from WhatsApp, it generates various statistics, such as message counts, word clouds, user activity, emojis, and more. The goal of this project is to provide you with meaningful insights from your WhatsApp conversations, whether for fun or data analysis purposes.

## Features

This project provides the following features:

1. **Message Statistics**: 
   - Displays the total number of messages in the chat.
   - Counts the number of media files (e.g., images, videos) shared.
   - Counts the number of links shared in the chat.

2. **Most Active Users**:
   - Identifies the users who are most active in the chat based on message counts.
   - Provides a detailed report on the percentage of activity per user.

3. **Word Cloud**:
   - Generates a word cloud of the most frequently used words in the chat, excluding stop words (such as common filler words).

4. **Emoji Analysis**:
   - Displays the most frequently used emojis in the chat, giving insight into the emotional tone of the conversation.

5. **Activity Heatmap**:
   - Visualizes the distribution of messages across different days of the week and times of the day, helping to identify active periods.

6. **Monthly/Daily Reports**:
   - Provides activity reports broken down by day and month to show how chat activity evolves over time.
